- **Read explanations**: Understand the reasoning behind each verdict

### Examples of claims to verify:
- "The moon landing was faked"
- "COVID-19 originated from bats"
- "Is the Earth flat?"

### Verification Process
Each verification provides:
- A verdict: **TRUE / FALSE / UNVERIFIABLE**
- An explanation of the reasoning
- Source links from top search results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Firebase Emulator Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - **Issue**: "Port 9099 is not available"
   - **Solution**: Kill the process using that port or change it in firebase.json
     ```bash
     sudo lsof -i :9099
     kill -9 [PID]
     ```

2. **Authentication Emulator Connection Issues**
   - **Issue**: App can't connect to Firebase Auth emulator
   - **Solution**: Ensure you're using the emulator in your Flutter code
     ```dart
     if (kDebugMode) {
       await FirebaseAuth.instance.useAuthEmulator('localhost', 9099);
     }
     ```

#### API Connection Issues

1. **CSE API Quota Limits**
   - **Issue**: "Quota exceeded for API key"
   - **Solution**: Check your Google Cloud Console usage, increase quota, or implement caching

2. **Gemini API Response Issues**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent or unexpected responses
   - **Solution**: Review prompt engineering, ensure proper context is provided to the model

#### Flutter App Issues

1. **Hot Reload Not Working**
   - **Issue**: Changes not reflected after hot reload
   - **Solution**: Try hot restart or check if state is preserved properly

2. **Firebase Auth State Not Persisting**
   - **Issue**: User logged out unexpectedly
   - **Solution**: Ensure Firebase initialization is correct and persistence is enabled
